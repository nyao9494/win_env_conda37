    partdesign: fix failing tapered hole test
    
    The given parameters return an invalid shape. This fails with occt7.4 but doesn't with occt7.3. If the angle is 45 degree the cone is self-intersecting as Hole.Depth > Hole.Diameter/2. Changing the Hole.TaperedAngle to 60 degree solves this issue.
